<!-- 1. Benefits of NodeJS -->

1. Scalability : 
Node.js uses a single thread to handle non-blocking I/O calls, which means that it’ll take fewer resources for the application to accept concurrent connections compared to traditional approaches. 

2. Single Programming Language : 
With front-end applications developed with JavaScript, there is no need to pick up a different language when using Node.js for the backend.

3. Freedom to Develop Cross Platform App : 
There is no constraint to building back-end applications when using Node.js. It can be coupled with other frameworks which enables to build cross-platform applications.

4. High Performance: 
Unlike other platforms, its single-threaded, event-driven architecture processes multiple concurrent requests efficiently without clogging the RAM. Moreover, its event-loop and non-blocking I/O operations allow code execution at a pace which significantly impacts the application’s overall performance.

5. Cross-Platform Development:
With Node.js, you can leverage platforms like Electron and NW.js to build cross-platform real-time web applications. Hence there is no need to invest time behind writing separate codes for various desktop versions – Windows, Linux, and macOS.

6. Extensibility : 
 Node.js can be easily extended and customized for rapidly growing enterprises. Node.js can be extended by leveraging built-in API for developing HTTP and DNS servers and JSON, a data format, which makes data exchange between client and web servers extremely easy.

7. Simple to Learn : 
Javascript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the developer’s community. It is a lot easier to adapt and learn Node.js for web application development and other popular Node.js use cases. It takes less time to write codes.

8. Large Community Support:
With millions of developers contributing actively to the Node.js community, there is extensive support from development experts across the globe to solve even the most peculiar development problems.

9. Web App Development Speed:
Since Node.js is lightweight, it enables developers to accelerate the overall development speed. What’s more, and there are numerous libraries, ready-to-use codes, and other resources from GitHub, which, in turn, saves a lot of coding time and effort.
Node.js also offers client-side and server-side in Javascript, making it easier and faster to manage code and data files than other similar technologies. In addition to this, its deployments assist you in receiving feedback from the production environment to execution, which also contributes to shortening your application’s time-to-market.

10. Improved App Response Time:
Node.js, with its single-threaded event-loop model, offers a non-blocking asynchronous architecture without creating more threads by employing fewer resources. This helps boost the responsiveness of your application since it can deal with multiple concurrent users simultaneously.

11. Caching:
Node.js has made it easy for developers to reduce task workload and re-execution of code with its caching module. So every time the first module of a web application gets a request, it gets cached in the in-app memory. This way, within a fraction of microseconds, users get to quickly access the web pages without having to wait for too long.
